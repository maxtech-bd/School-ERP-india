Hi team,

The current Transfer Certificate design looks very plain and basic (see attached screenshot). I’d like to make it look professional and attractive — similar to official school certificates with branding and layout polish.

Here’s what I’d like implemented in the updated version:

🎓 Updated Transfer Certificate Design Requirements

Header Section (Professional Layout)

Add school logo (left) and school tagline centered

Include address, phone, email, and website in one line

Use a clean header color: #1E3A8A (Deep Blue)

Example:

DEMO SCHOOL  
"Excellence in Learning and Character"  
123 Learning City | info@demoschool.edu | (555) 123-4567  


Certificate Title Section

Title centered: “🏆 TRANSFER CERTIFICATE 🏆”

Use bold 22px text with a subtle gold divider line below

Student Information Table (Modern Styling)

Display all student details in a clean bordered or shaded table:

Student Name, Admission No, Class, Section, Date of Admission, Date of Leaving, Reason for Transfer, Conduct & Behavior, Issue Date, Certificate ID

Use a light background (#F8FAFC) with icons (📅, 🧑‍🎓, 🏷️) beside labels

Font: Poppins or Roboto for neat alignment

Signature Section

Two signature boxes:

Left: Class Teacher (Signature)

Right: Principal (Signature)

Option to upload digital signature images

Footer Section

Add generated info:
Generated on: 05/10/2025 | Certificate ID: #### | Verified by DEMO SCHOOL

Include a QR code for online verification

Add a faint school logo watermark in background

Color & Font Scheme

Header: #1E3A8A

Accent/Highlight: #059669 (Emerald Green)

Text: #111827

Footer: #6B7280

Font: Poppins / Roboto

✅ Expected Output

When clicking View / Download / Print, the certificate should:

Display the full styled layout (not plain text)

Render correctly in PDF with header, table, QR, and watermark

Automatically include student + school data dynamically

Please update the Transfer Certificate template in the ERP according to this design standard.
This will make the document look official, elegant, and consistent with other reports.

Thank you! 🚀
