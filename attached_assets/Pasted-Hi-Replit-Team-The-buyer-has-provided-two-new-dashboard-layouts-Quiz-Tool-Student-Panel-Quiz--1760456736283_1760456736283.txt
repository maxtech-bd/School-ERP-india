Hi Replit Team,

The buyer has provided two new dashboard layouts — Quiz Tool (Student Panel)

Quiz Tool Dashboard Layout

 and Test Generator (Teacher/Admin Panel)

Test Generator Dashboard Layout

 — which now need to be integrated into our existing School ERP AI Assistant system.
Below is the full implementation plan according to their requirements:

🎯 1. AI Quiz Tool (Student Panel)

Scope: Grades 1–12
User Role: Student

Core Features:
✅ Filters: Class · Subject · Chapter · Topic
✅ Difficulty Levels: Easy · Medium · Hard
✅ Tags (Learning Dimensions): Knowledge · Understanding · Application · Reasoning · Skills

AI Functions:

AI dynamically generates quizzes based on selected filters and tags.

Quizzes are for self-assessment and practice only (not for grading).

After submission:

Auto-correction

Auto-grading

Instant feedback + progress tracking

UI Components:

“Start Quiz” → Generate customized question set

“Regenerate” → Refresh question set

“Save” → Save quiz for later

“Submit” → Evaluate quiz automatically

“View Results” → Show performance dashboard

Automation:

AI fetches tagged questions from CMS-first database.

Tracks student performance history for progress insights.

🎯 2. AI Test Generator (Teacher/Admin Panel)

Scope: Grades 1–12
User Roles: Teacher, Admin, Student (as recipient)

A) AI-Powered Test Generator

✅ Teachers can generate tests instantly using AI.
✅ Example: Generate 10 questions → keep 5, regenerate 5.
✅ Schedule delivery to students (auto-publish on time).
✅ Auto-Correction + Auto-Grading after test submission.

UI Actions:
Generate · Edit · Save · Schedule · Publish · View Results

B) Manual Upload Option

✅ Teachers can upload existing question papers manually.
✅ Supports scheduling for timed delivery.
✅ Same auto-grading & result reporting system applies.

UI Actions:
Upload · Save · Schedule · Publish · View Results

🧠 Shared Tag System (for both)

AI categorizes questions using these cognitive tags:

Knowledge

Understanding

Application

Reasoning

Skills

This ensures AI generates balanced and subject-appropriate question sets for both Quiz and Test modules.

🔧 Technical Integration Plan

Database:

Extend existing academic_content and qa_pairs collections.

Add tagging fields: difficulty, topic, learning_tag, type.

Backend APIs:

POST /api/quiz/generate → AI generates quiz (student side)

POST /api/test/generate → AI generates test (teacher side)

POST /api/test/upload → Manual upload

POST /api/test/schedule → Schedule test delivery

GET /api/quiz/results & /api/test/results → Fetch graded data

Frontend UI:

Add two new dashboards:

Quiz Tool (Student Panel)

Test Generator (Teacher/Admin Panel)

Both connect to existing AI Assistant backend and CMS database.

Evaluation Engine:

Use same auto-correction logic as AI Assistant’s evaluation.

Generate detailed performance reports.

📊 Expected Outcome

✅ AI Quiz → Student self-practice with instant grading
✅ AI Test → Teacher/admin generated exams with scheduling
✅ Auto-grading & performance tracking
✅ Unified tag system ensures academic balance
✅ CMS-first integration reduces GPT cost and improves accuracy

Please start implementation according to these layouts and integrate them into the existing ERP AI Assistant system — ensuring both panels (Quiz & Test Generator) follow the same academic restriction logic and token optimization.

Thank you,
