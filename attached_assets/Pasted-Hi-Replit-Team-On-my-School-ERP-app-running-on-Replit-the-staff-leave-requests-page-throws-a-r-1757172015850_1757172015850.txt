Hi Replit Team,

On my School ERP app (running on Replit), the /staff/leave-requests page throws a runtime error and shows the red overlay:

A <Select.Item /> must have a value prop that is not an empty string. This is because the Select value can be set to an empty string to clear the selection and show the placeholder.

Steps to reproduce

Navigate to Staff → Leave Requests.

Page mounts and immediately crashes with the error above.

Expected

Page should render the Leave Request form (type/date/etc.) with dropdowns working.

Actual

Runtime error overlay; page unusable.

Suspected cause

I’m using shadcn/ui Select. One or more <SelectItem> has value="" (empty string), or the controlled value of <Select> is "" initially. In shadcn, every SelectItem must have a non-empty value, and the <Select> should start as undefined or a real value.

Suggested fix (code)
// ❌ Problematic (empty value)
<Select value={type} onValueChange={setType}>
  <SelectTrigger><SelectValue placeholder="Select type" /></SelectTrigger>
  <SelectContent>
    <SelectItem value="">-- Select --</SelectItem>  // <-- remove or change
    <SelectItem value="SICK">Sick Leave</SelectItem>
    <SelectItem value="CASUAL">Casual Leave</SelectItem>
    <SelectItem value="ANNUAL">Annual Leave</SelectItem>
  </SelectContent>
</Select>

// ✅ Correct
const [type, setType] = useState<string | undefined>(undefined); // not ""

<Select value={type} onValueChange={setType}>
  <SelectTrigger><SelectValue placeholder="Select type" /></SelectTrigger>
  <SelectContent>
    {/* no empty-value items */}
    <SelectItem value="SICK">Sick Leave</SelectItem>
    <SelectItem value="CASUAL">Casual Leave</SelectItem>
    <SelectItem value="ANNUAL">Annual Leave</SelectItem>
    <SelectItem value="UNPAID">Unpaid Leave</SelectItem>
  </SelectContent>
</Select>

// If a placeholder row is needed:
<SelectItem value="__placeholder" disabled className="text-muted-foreground">
  Select type…
</SelectItem>


Also ensure any other selects (department, status, staff pickers) follow the same pattern:

initial state undefined (not "")

every <SelectItem> has a non-empty value

don’t coerce falsy values to "" when mapping options

Environment

React 19 / shadcn/ui on Replit

Route: /staff/leave-requests

Could you help patch this across the Leave Requests page (and any similar selects) so the page renders?

Thanks,
Farid
