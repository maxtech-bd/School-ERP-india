Subject: HSS → Enroll Student shows blank page (no component rendered)

Hi Replit Team,

In my School ERP app, clicking HSS Module → Enroll Student opens a completely blank view—no header, no wizard, nothing. (Screenshot attached.)

Expected

Route /hss/enroll (or /hss/enroll/new) should render the Enrollment screen/wizard:

Step 1: Student lookup or create

Step 2: Academic year, stream/group, class, section

Step 3: Subject selection (with limits)

Step 4: Documents (photo/TC/marksheet)

Step 5: Fees & summary → Submit creates an enrollments record and redirects to details/register with a success toast.

Actual

Page is blank; nothing renders.

Likely causes

Route not mapped (e.g., missing <Route path="enroll" element={<HssEnrollLanding/>} />).

Component import fails or lazy import chunk not loading (check network tab).

Guard/catch-all route intercepting (e.g., ProtectedRoute or Route path="*" placed earlier).

Runtime error suppressed (React error boundary or silent promise rejection).

Button navigates to a path that doesn’t exist (e.g., /hss/enroll vs /hss/enroll/new).

Suggested fixes

1) Hook up the button

// HSS Module header button
<Button type="button" onClick={() => navigate("/hss/enroll")}>
  New Enrollment
</Button>


2) Define the routes

<Route path="/hss">
  <Route index element={<HssDashboard />} />
  <Route path="enroll" element={
    <ProtectedRoute roles={['admin','super_admin']}>
      <HssEnrollLanding /> {/* or NewEnrollmentWizard */}
    </ProtectedRoute>
  } />
  <Route path="enroll/new" element={
    <ProtectedRoute roles={['admin','super_admin']}>
      <NewEnrollmentWizard />
    </ProtectedRoute>
  } />
</Route>


3) Guard behavior

On 401 → redirect to /login (not dashboard)

On 403 → /403

Do not redirect authorized users away from /hss/enroll

4) Quick diagnostics

Open Console & Network when clicking the menu: any 404 chunk, import error, or React error?

Temporarily render a placeholder:

export default function HssEnrollLanding() {
  return <div data-test="enroll-ready">Enrollment screen loaded</div>;
}


If this shows, the route works and the issue is inside the wizard component.

5) Backend endpoints to enable (if not already)

GET  /api/hss/lookups          // years, streams, classes, sections, subjects
POST /api/hss/enrollments      // create enrollment
GET  /api/hss/enrollments/:id  // view
POST /api/files                // uploads


Could you wire up the route/component so Enroll Student renders the enrollment wizard and persists data as above?

Thanks,
Farid
