Got it, Farid. Here’s a tight spec for Staff → Add Staff so you can build it properly in Replit.

🎯 Goal

Create a complete “Add Staff” flow that saves a staff member and updates the UI without bouncing to the dashboard.

🧾 Form Fields (recommended)

Identity

Employee ID (auto/optional manual, unique per tenant)

Full Name (required)

Gender, Date of Birth

Photo upload (JPEG/PNG ≤ 2 MB)

Contact

Email (required, unique, lowercase)

Phone (required, E.164)

Address (line, city, state, postal code)

Employment

Department (Teaching, Admin, Accounts, etc.)

Designation (Head Teacher, Clerk, etc.)

Role (admin | teacher | staff | … for RBAC)

Date of Joining (required)

Employment Type (Full-time / Part-time / Contract)

Experience (years, number 0–50)

Monthly Salary (number ≥ 0)

Status (Active | Inactive)

Teaching (if role = teacher)

Classes/Sections (multi-select)

Subjects (multi-select)

✅ Validation (front + back)

Required: name, email, phone, role, department, date_of_joining

Unique: email, employee_id (scoped to tenant)

Formats: email, phone, salary as number, photo type/size

Block duplicate on server with 409 + friendly message:
“Email already exists for this school.”

🧠 UX Behavior

Page title: “Add Staff”

Buttons:

Save (creates staff then takes to Staff Profile)

Save & Add Another (creates, clears form, keeps you here)

Cancel / Back to Staff List

Live feedback: inline field errors + top toast (“Staff added successfully”)

Keep data on error: don’t clear the form

Loading state: disable Save while posting

RBAC: only admin/super_admin may access this route; others see 403 page (not dashboard redirect)

🔌 API Contract (example)

Create staff
POST /api/staff

{
  "employeeId": "EMP-2025-0012",
  "name": "Ayesha Khan",
  "email": "ayesha@school.edu",
  "phone": "+8801712345678",
  "department": "Teaching",
  "designation": "Science Teacher",
  "role": "teacher",
  "dateOfJoining": "2025-09-06",
  "experienceYears": 5,
  "salaryMonthly": 20000,
  "address": "West Gohira",
  "status": "Active",
  "gender": "Female"
}


Response 201

{
  "id": "66df…",
  "tenantId": "…",
  "createdAt": "…"
}


Lookups

GET /api/departments

GET /api/designations

GET /api/roles → for dropdowns

Photo upload (optional)

POST /api/files → returns fileId/url, include in staff payload

🧱 Data Model (MongoDB)
{
  _id,
  tenantId,
  employeeId,
  name,
  email,
  phone,
  department,
  designation,
  role,               // for RBAC
  dateOfJoining,
  experienceYears,
  salaryMonthly,
  address,
  status,             // Active/Inactive
  gender,
  photoUrl,
  classes: [classId], // if teacher
  subjects: [subjectId],
  createdBy,
  createdAt, updatedAt
}


Indexes

{ tenantId, email } unique

{ tenantId, employeeId } unique

🧭 Routing (React Router)

/staff/add → AddStaff page (guarded)

On success:

Update header counters (Total Staff)

Invalidate/refresh GET /api/staff list

Redirect to /staff/:id or /staff with toast

🛡️ Guard & Errors

Unauthorized → /login (not dashboard)

Forbidden role → /403 with message

Server errors → toast + keep form

Network retry banner if offline

🧪 Acceptance Checklist

 Admin can open /staff/add without redirect

 Required fields block submission with clear messages

 Duplicate email/employeeId returns friendly error

 Save → creates record, shows success toast, updates counters

 Save & Add Another → stays on page with cleared form

 Cancel → returns to Staff List

 Non-admin gets 403 page

 State persists if submit fails

🔮 Nice to have (later)

CSV Import (bulk staff) with progress + error report

“Generate Employee ID” button with prefix per school

Audit log: who created/edited staff

Soft delete (status=Inactive) instead of hard delete
