Hi Replit Team 👋

I’ve completed a full QA testing of our School ERP System after deployment.
Even though the main system loads successfully, several functional and UI-level modules are still broken.
Below is the list of critical issues that remain unresolved despite multiple fixes:


---

⚫ UI & Layout Problems

Dark Mode isn’t applied properly — background & button text colors are inconsistent.

Some button labels are invisible in Dark Mode.

Sidebar bug: Interface scrolls to the top every time a new component is clicked.



---

🎓 Student Module Issues

Import Students option not working — keeps showing “Invalid Data Format” error even after uploading valid Excel/CSV files.

Bulk Photo Upload not working — “Upload Successful” toast shows, but photos are not visible afterward.

Individual Photo Upload section under Students Module has no functionality (upload buttons inactive).



---

👨‍🏫 Staff Management Issues

Staff Information Update and Delete functions not working.

Staff Import feature fails every time — same error persists even after correcting CSV data.



---

🏫 Leave & Class Management

“Leave Type” dropdown missing under New Leave Request — user cannot create new leave requests.

Class Management Module not functional — sections cannot be created or edited.



---

📜 HSS Module Problems

HSS Transfer Certificate status cannot be changed (Draft → Issued → Cancelled).

Conduct Certificate status cannot be changed.

HSS submodules (Enroll Student, Admission Register, Transfer Certificate, Conduct Certificate, Consolidated Report, Set Tags) are all non-functional.

Save Configuration options for Manage Fees Tab are not visible.



---

🧠 AI Tools & CMS Issues

AI Summary output contains raw code syntax (JSON tags, HTML) — not human readable.

AI Test Generator and AI Quiz Generator fail to generate tests.

AI Assistant not responding (no backend communication).



---

📊 Reports & Settings

All tabs under Report Dashboard are inactive (no data rendering).

Settings → Biometric Devices crashes the page (console logs show JS error).

Calendar module works fine ✅



---

⚙ Admission & Date Validation

Online Application status cannot be changed (read-only state).

Admission Settings section not configurable.

Date Picker allows invalid/future dates (e.g., Admission Date, DOB).

Expected: validation or alert for invalid/future dates

Actual: accepts any date without restriction




---

💡 Request

Please assign a full-stack engineer to recheck the following:

1. Backend endpoints for the above modules (especially under /students, /staff, /fees, /ai, /hss, /settings)


2. Frontend event binding for inactive buttons


3. AI module integration (Quiz, Summary, Assistant)


4. Validation logic for date and data imports



Once fixes are applied, please redeploy to verify in staging before production.
