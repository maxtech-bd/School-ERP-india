🚨 TOP-PRIORITY FIXES NEEDED

Fix all non-functional buttons (Quick Action, Import, Upload, Save)

Implement form validations (Student, HSS, Staff)

Enable department filter logic in staff attendance

Integrate photo upload validation + feedback toasts

Fix HSS status transitions (Draft → Issued)

React state sync issues between Dashboard ↔ Admission

Enable Fee Module CRUD operations

Fix DatePicker restriction (Accounts module)

✅ Final Recommendations

Run frontend debugging (React DevTools → Console Logs)

Check API binding failures (FastAPI endpoints returning 200/400)

Use toast.success / error handlers for all actions

Re-test with autoscale deployment after fixing Replit build type

Maintain Changelog for all fixed items for next regression test
