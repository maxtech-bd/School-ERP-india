Hi Replit,

Please enable the Staff Photo Upload feature — both individual upload and bulk upload, similar to the existing student module.

📸 Requested Features:
1️⃣ Individual Staff Photo Upload

Add a small camera icon or “Upload Photo” button in the Add / Edit Staff Member form.

The uploaded image should:

Save to /uploads/staff/{employee_id}_{uuid}.jpg

Update the photo_url field in the staff database table

Display as a circular avatar in the Staff List table (replacing initials)

2️⃣ Bulk Photo Upload (same style as Students)

Add a “Bulk Photo Upload” button beside Import Staff / Export.

The modal should include:

Title: “Bulk Photo Upload (Staff)”

File format allowed: .jpg, .png

Rule: File name must match the staff Employee ID
e.g.

EMP-2025-0004.jpg
EMP-2025-0005.jpg
EMP-2025-0007.jpg


Max size: 2MB per image

Recommended: 300x400 pixels

On upload → system auto-links photo with corresponding employee

✅ Expected Behavior:

Uploaded photos are saved under /uploads/staff/

Database updates staff record with photo_url

Staff List immediately displays uploaded avatars

If photo not found → fallback initials shown (like now)

⚙️ Backend Implementation Suggestion:
@app.post("/api/staff/bulk-photo-upload")
async def upload_staff_photos(files: List[UploadFile] = File(...)):
    for file in files:
        filename = file.filename
        employee_id = filename.split(".")[0]
        staff = db.query(Staff).filter(Staff.employee_id == employee_id).first()
        if staff:
            save_path = f"uploads/staff/{filename}"
            with open(save_path, "wb") as buffer:
                shutil.copyfileobj(file.file, buffer)
            staff.photo_url = f"/uploads/staff/{filename}"
            db.commit()
    return {"message": "Photos uploaded successfully"}

🧾 Benefit:

Consistent with Student module

Saves manual upload time for large staff databases

Ensures uniform UI and easy management of staff records

Once implemented, both Student and Staff modules will have identical bulk photo systems.
