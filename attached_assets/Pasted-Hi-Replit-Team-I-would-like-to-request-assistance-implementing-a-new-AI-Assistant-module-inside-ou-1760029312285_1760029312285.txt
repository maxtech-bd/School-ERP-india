Hi Replit Team,

I would like to request assistance implementing a new AI Assistant module inside our School ERP system (MaxTech BD) — fully integrated with OCR, Voice, and n8n automation.

🚨 Important Instruction:
Please do not touch or modify any other existing modules (HSS, Fees, Reports, Transport, etc.).
Only focus on integrating and testing the new AI Assistant feature under a separate section — “AI Assistant.”

🔹 Feature Requirements

1. AI Assistant (GPT-4o-mini)

Students and teachers can ask academic questions using text, image, or voice.

AI should respond with:

📘 Academic or textbook-based answers

📗 Reference explanations

🤖 Simplified AI-generated summaries


Include text + voice response output.



2. OCR (Image Reading)

Integrate Tesseract OCR (open-source) to extract text from images or scanned documents.

Run locally to avoid external API costs.



3. Voice Input / Output

Use Whisper.cpp (Speech-to-Text) for converting student voice queries to text.

Use OpenAI TTS or ElevenLabs Lite for converting AI responses to voice playback.



4. n8n Automation Integration

Automate background processes using n8n:

Log AI activity and responses

Send notifications to teachers

Trigger smart workflows (e.g., “AI Homework Summary,” “Study Tips Reminder”)

💡 Suggested Setup Plan (Optimized for Low Cost)

Layer	Tool / Tech	Description	Cost

🤖 AI Core	GPT-4o-mini (OpenAI API)	Text reasoning + answer generation	~$3/mo
🧠 OCR	Tesseract (self-hosted)	Free image-to-text conversion	$0
🎙 Voice	Whisper.cpp + OpenAI TTS	Voice recognition + voice reply	~$1/mo
🔁 Automation	n8n (self-hosted)	Workflow automation & logging	$0
☁ Hosting	Replit + Render	Shared deployment	~$8/mo
💾 Database	Supabase Free Tier	Store AI logs & usage data	$0


✅ Estimated Monthly Cost: $10 – $12 total

⚙ Implementation Recommendations (from ChatGPT)

To ensure stability and performance:

Use async FastAPI routes for all AI and OCR requests.

Add a separate route group (/ai-engine) to isolate this feature.

Use local caching for common questions (reduce API cost by 40–60%).

Implement Redis / n8n queue for background automation (non-blocking).

Add teacher logs for activity tracking and accountability.

Embed a mini AI chat widget inside the ERP dashboard for direct interaction.



---

🎯 Expected Behavior

✅ Students can ask questions (text, photo, or voice)
✅ AI Assistant responds instantly inside ERP
✅ Teachers can view AI usage logs
✅ n8n handles automation and notifications
✅ System remains low-cost, fast, and isolated from other modules

📍 Key Notes

Please implement this module as a separate standalone feature.

Do not modify or update any other School ERP sections or existing logic.

Keep the architecture modular so it can be expanded later to other schools.

Thank you for your continuous support.
Once this AI module is implemented and stable, I plan to roll it out across all MaxTech BD School ERP deployments.
