Hello Replit Team,

I’ve tested the Accounts Module in my ERP system, and several key functionalities are missing or non-functional.

🔴 Current Issues:

Transaction Buttons:

Add Transaction → Opens form but data is not saved to backend.

Edit → Not updating records.

Print → Not generating printable/exportable receipts.

Export Table → No export file generated (Excel/PDF missing).

Dashboard Metrics:

Opening Balance, Closing Balance, Total Income, and Total Expenses are static.

They do not update after adding/editing/deleting transactions.

Transaction History:

Transactions are not persisting to the database.

On page reload, data is lost.

✅ Expected Behavior:

Add Transaction:

Should allow adding both Income (student fees, grants, donations) and Expenses (salaries, bills, utilities).

On save → Transaction saved to database, instantly reflected in Transaction History + Dashboard metrics.

Edit Transaction:

Should allow updating description, category, amount, and payment method.

Changes should be persisted and metrics recalculated.

Print / Export:

Print → Generate PDF/printable transaction slips.

Export Table → Export full transaction history to Excel/PDF with proper formatting.

Dashboard Calculations:

Opening Balance → Carried from previous period.

Closing Balance → Auto-calculated: Opening Balance + Total Income – Total Expenses.

Total Income / Expenses → Aggregated from all transactions.

Net Balance → Must update instantly after every transaction.

Filters (Day/Month/Year/Category/Type):

Should allow filtering transactions by date range, category (Fees, Utilities, Salaries), and type (Income/Expense).

Dashboard should refresh dynamically with filtered totals.

🎯 My Request:

Please enable full Accounts Module functionality with backend integration so that:

All transactions persist in the database.

Dashboard metrics auto-refresh in real-time.

Add/Edit/Delete/Print/Export buttons are fully operational.

Reports (Excel/PDF) are downloadable with proper formatting.

This will make the Accounts module a complete financial management tool, aligned with ERP standards.
