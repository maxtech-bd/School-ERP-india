Hi Replit Team 👋,

I’m currently facing a deployment issue with my full-stack School ERP project.
The app works perfectly in preview mode (URL:
https://3516d251-7e36-40e8-b0eb-3a3eaa6959f7-00-3t9xpjugl0f0e.pike.replit.dev/login
)
but fails to load on the production deployment URL:
https://erp-jahirvklbd.replit.app
 → shows only “Not Found”.

🧩 Details:

Build succeeds ✅

Bundle stage completes ✅ (no visible errors)

Deployment promotes successfully

But visiting the deployed domain shows: “Not Found”

🧠 Analysis so far:

Backend (FastAPI + Uvicorn) runs perfectly in preview mode.

Deployment seems unable to detect or serve frontend static files after build.

The app has a frontend/dist React build folder and backend served via Uvicorn on port 5000.

I’ve confirmed .replit configuration uses only one port mapping (5000 → 80).

Using “Reserved VM” (0.5 vCPU / 2 GB RAM) configuration.

[[ports]]
localPort = 5000
externalPort = 80

[deployment]
deploymentTarget = "reserved_vm"
run = ["sh", "-c", "cd backend && python -m uvicorn server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000"]
build = ["sh", "-c", "cd frontend && yarn install && yarn build --no-source-map && cd ../backend && pip install -r requirements.txt"]


🔍 Expected Behavior:
The deployed URL (https://erp-jahirvklbd.replit.app
) should show the same login page that appears on the preview URL.

⚠️ Actual Behavior:
The deployment runs, but visiting the production URL only displays:

Not Found


💡 What I suspect:

The Uvicorn backend starts correctly, but Replit deployment cannot detect the route because it may not be serving static files (index.html) from /frontend/dist.

Deployment environment behaves differently from the editor preview environment.

Can you please:
1️⃣ Check the Replit deployment logs for this project (erp-jahirvklbd)
2️⃣ Confirm whether the backend process is running after deployment
3️⃣ Let me know if the routing or startup detection is failing internally

Thanks for your help 🙏
