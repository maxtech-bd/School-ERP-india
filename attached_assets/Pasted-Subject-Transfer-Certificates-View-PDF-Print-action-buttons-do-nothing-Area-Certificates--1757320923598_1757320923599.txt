Subject: Transfer Certificates – “View / PDF / Print” action buttons do nothing

Area: Certificates → Transfer tab
Record state: Status = Issued (TC exists in the table)

Steps to reproduce

Go to /certificates and select the Transfer tab.

Ensure there is at least one issued TC in the list.

Click View, PDF, or Print in the Actions column.

Actual result

Nothing happens (no modal, no navigation, no download, no print dialog).

The buttons appear enabled but have no effect.

Expected behavior

View: Opens a preview modal/page for the selected Transfer Certificate.

PDF: Triggers a file download of the TC as a PDF (e.g., TC_ADM5555_2025-09-09.pdf).

Print: Opens a print-friendly view and the browser print dialog.

What to check (suggestions)

Frontend:

Verify the onClick handlers are wired with the row’s TC ID and not blocked by preventDefault() or missing routing.

If they’re <a> tags with href="#", ensure click handlers call the correct functions and that the default action isn’t swallowing navigation.

For PDF, use a direct GET to the file endpoint and window.open(url, '_blank') or programmatic download.

For Print, open a print view (new tab or hidden iframe) and call window.print() when ready.

Backend/API routes (examples):

GET /transfer-certificates/{id} → returns certificate data for View.

GET /transfer-certificates/{id}/pdf → returns application/pdf for PDF.

(Option A) GET /transfer-certificates/{id}/print → print-friendly HTML, or
(Option B) reuse the PDF endpoint and open in a new tab for printing.

Permissions/guards:

Make sure actions are enabled for Issued (and any allowed statuses) and not gated by role/tenant checks.

Confirm CORS/Content-Disposition headers for the PDF download.

Acceptance criteria

Clicking View opens a preview with the correct TC data.

Clicking PDF downloads/opens the PDF in a new tab.

Clicking Print opens a print-friendly view and shows the browser print dialog.

Errors (network/permission) show a user-friendly toast instead of silent failure.
