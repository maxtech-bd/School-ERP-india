Subject: Certificates → “Transfer Certificate” selection does nothing after modal

Environment:
Replit preview · School ERP → Certificates page

Steps to reproduce:

Go to Certificates page.

Click Generate Certificate (modal opens).

Click Transfer Certificate in the modal.

Actual result:

Nothing happens: the modal stays on the same screen, no form/wizard opens, no navigation, no errors shown.

No network requests are fired (or if they are, there’s no UI response).

Expected behavior:

After selecting Transfer Certificate, the app should proceed to the TC creation flow. Either:

Open a TC Wizard (stepper) inside the modal, or

Close the modal and navigate to a new TC page (e.g., /certificates/transfer/new) that shows:

Student selection (search by name/admission no)

Certificate details (admission no, date of admission, last class/section, date of leaving, reason, conduct/remarks, template selector)

Preview & Generate

On Generate, show success toast and redirect back to Certificates list with the new record visible.

If no templates exist, show a friendly prompt to create/select a template (not a dead-end).

What to check (suggested fix points):

Click handler in the modal options: is the onClick for Transfer Certificate wired to navigation or the next modal step?

Route/state: verify a route exists and is reachable (e.g., /certificates/transfer/new) or the compound modal step is implemented.

Guard rails: if templates or prerequisites are missing, show a guided message instead of doing nothing.

Console & Network tab: look for suppressed errors or blocked navigation; verify an API/template bootstrap call isn’t failing silently.

Accessibility overlay: confirm the modal isn’t blocking pointer events to the next UI.

Acceptance criteria:

Selecting Transfer Certificate reliably opens the TC creation flow.

Users can select a student, fill details, select template, preview, and generate.

Success toast shows and the new certificate appears in the list with View / Download PDF / Print actions.

All error states show clear messages (e.g., “No templates found—add one to continue”).

Thanks!
