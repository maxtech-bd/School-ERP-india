You are a senior enterprise SaaS architect and full-stack engineer.

You are working inside an EXISTING Replit ERP project.
Do NOT rebuild the project.
Do NOT change existing architecture unless required.
Extend the system cleanly.

GOAL:
Implement a Super Admin feature called “School List” which acts as the MASTER CONTROL PANEL
for all schools (Genuine + Dummy) in the ERP system.

-----------------------------------
1️⃣ SIDEBAR NAVIGATION (MANDATORY)
-----------------------------------
- Add a new sidebar menu item:
  - Label: "School List"
  - Position: TOP-MOST item
  - Must appear ABOVE:
    - Home
    - Admission Summary
- Sidebar visibility:
  - Only for Super Admin role
  - Hidden for Admin / Teacher / Student / Parent

-----------------------------------
2️⃣ SCHOOL LIST PURPOSE
-----------------------------------
School List is a centralized control panel for Super Admin to manage:
- Genuine (Real Client) Schools
- Dummy / Demo / Test Schools

Both must appear in the SAME list.

-----------------------------------
3️⃣ SCHOOL LIST TABLE (UI + DATA)
-----------------------------------
Display the following columns:
- School Name
- School Type (Small / Medium / Large)
- Package (Money XXXX RS)
- Created Date
- School Mode (Genuine / Dummy)

Features:
- Pagination
- Search by school name
- Filter by:
  - School Type
  - Package
  - School Mode (Genuine / Dummy)

-----------------------------------
4️⃣ SCHOOL TYPES & FLAGS (CRITICAL LOGIC)
-----------------------------------
Each school MUST have:
- is_dummy (boolean)
- school_type ENUM('small','medium','large')

Rules:
- is_dummy = false → Genuine School
- is_dummy = true → Dummy / Demo School

This flag controls DELETE permission.

-----------------------------------
5️⃣ CLICK BEHAVIOR (SCHOOL SWITCHING)
-----------------------------------
When Super Admin clicks ANY school row:

Redirect to:
  → [Selected School] → HOME → GiNi School Dashboard

Implementation rules:
- Switch active tenant context dynamically
- Load the selected school's LIVE dashboard data
- No page reload hacks
- No duplicate login

-----------------------------------
6️⃣ GiNi SCHOOL DASHBOARD CONTROL
-----------------------------------
For BOTH Genuine and Dummy schools:
Super Admin can:
- View dashboard metrics
- Manipulate dashboard data
- Modify stats for:
  - Monitoring
  - Support
  - Demo
  - Analytics verification

This manipulation must:
- NOT affect other schools
- Be isolated per school (tenant-safe)

-----------------------------------
7️⃣ DELETION RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
-----------------------------------
IF school.is_dummy === true:
- Allow:
  - Edit school
  - Delete school
- Deletion must:
  - Soft delete OR hard delete safely
  - Remove only dummy data
  - NEVER touch genuine school data

IF school.is_dummy === false (Genuine):
- DELETE button MUST NOT exist
- API must BLOCK delete attempts
- Return 403 Forbidden if attempted manually

-----------------------------------
8️⃣ PERMISSION MATRIX (ENFORCED IN BACKEND)
-----------------------------------
| School Type | View Dashboard | Manipulate Data | Delete |
|------------|---------------|-----------------|--------|
| Genuine    | Yes           | Yes             | No     |
| Dummy      | Yes           | Yes             | Yes    |

-----------------------------------
9️⃣ BACKEND REQUIREMENTS (STRICT)
-----------------------------------
- Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Validate Super Admin role on every route
- Enforce delete protection at:
  - UI level
  - API level
- No hardcoded values
- No bypass via API tools

-----------------------------------
🔟 DATABASE & TENANCY SAFETY
-----------------------------------
- Use tenant_id / school_id in every dashboard query
- Prevent data leakage between schools
- Ensure dashboard manipulation affects ONLY selected school

-----------------------------------
1️⃣1️⃣ API REQUIREMENTS
-----------------------------------
Required endpoints:
- GET /super-admin/schools
- GET /super-admin/schools/:id
- DELETE /super-admin/schools/:id (Dummy only)
- POST /super-admin/schools/switch-context

All routes must:
- Validate inputs
- Handle errors gracefully
- Return consistent API responses

-----------------------------------
1️⃣2️⃣ UI/UX REQUIREMENTS
-----------------------------------
- Clear visual indicator:
  - Genuine School → Protected badge
  - Dummy School → Demo badge
- Disable delete button for genuine schools
- Confirmation modal for deletion

-----------------------------------
1️⃣3️⃣ FINAL SELF-CHECK (MANDATORY)
-----------------------------------
Before marking this feature complete:
- Verify genuine schools cannot be deleted
- Verify dummy schools can be deleted safely
- Verify dashboard switches correctly
- Verify no cross-school data leakage
- Verify sidebar order is correct

If ANY rule is unclear:
ASK BEFORE IMPLEMENTING.
Do NOT assume.
Do NOT skip.
